# Freudify App


Here I will show what we are doing and what else is left to do.
This project is for the following Hackathon: https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover

I have made the login and register and connected it to Mongodb. In order to rest this out, first cd backend. And then npm start. This will connect MongoDB.
Then create a new terminal thingy and npm start the freudify app itself. It might show a blank screen, so go to: http://localhost:3000/register, so that you can see the UI/
This will let you register: create a random email and password and it will save to the mongodb collection.
Then go to the login: you can type the same details you registered with, and it will take you to the summary page. 


There are some problems that are there such as the home page. I want to make it to where if the user is logged in, then the homepage will show the part where they can enter their dreams in. If they are not logged in, direct them to the login page. On the login page, add the link that leads to the register page, if they are not yet registered.

Now what we need to do is implement the API's that are on the website.

ChatGPT has the stuff about where we can implement the API's, so if you have any questions, ask our other partner lolz.
